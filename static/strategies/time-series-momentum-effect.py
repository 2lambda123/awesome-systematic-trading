# The investment universe consists of 24 commodity futures, 12 cross-currency pairs (with 9 underlying currencies), 9 developed equity indices, and 13 developed
# government bond futures.
# Every month, the investor considers whether the excess return of each asset over the past 12 months is positive or negative and goes long on the contract if it is
# positive and short if negative. The position size is set to be inversely proportional to the instrumentâ€™s volatility. A univariate GARCH model is used to estimated
# ex-ante volatility in the source paper. However, other simple models could probably be easily used with good results (for example, the easiest one would be using
# historical volatility instead of estimated volatility). The portfolio is rebalanced monthly.
#
# QC implementation changes:
#   - instead of GARCH model volatility, we have used simple historical volatility.
